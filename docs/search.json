    "text": "You can download the quarto files used to create the course notes using Git. You can update files using git pull but you will not be able to change the course notes on the main repository. This means that if you edit the files and then try to update then using git pull you will encounter conflicts. For this reason recommend that you make a copy before editing files. We have edited the .gitignore file so that if you add the word notes to your filenames, git will not track the files. So we recommend that you before editing you make a copy of the file and notes to the filename. For example 01-unix.qmd to 01-unix-notes.qmd.\nYou can download the files using git clone like this:\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to the directory you want to keep these notes in.\nType git clone  https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2024.git\n\nor using RStudio like this:\n\nGot to https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2024\nClick on the green “Clone or Download” on Github and copy the link.\nOpen RStudio, and go to File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git, and paste in the link you just copied. Under “Create Project as Sub-directory of”, browse and select a folder where you want the course materials to go.\nPress “Create Project”. This will create a folder called 2024 in the folder you selected in step 3.\nNow, you can open this project using the projects tab in the upper right of RStudio, or going to File &gt; Open Project and then navigating to the 2024 folder and opening the .Rproj file.\n\nOnce you cloned the course repository and want to get updates, you must use git pull to get updates. You can do this in the terminal or on the RStudio’s Git pane.\n\n\nIf you already cloned the repository outside of RStudio, you can associate the directory that was created in that step with RStudio. In RStudio, go to File &gt; New Project &gt; Existing Directory, and then navigate / click on the 2024 folder. Then click “Create Project”. Then you can follow step 5 above to open the project when you launch RStudio.\n\n\n\nAn alternative more advanced way to cloning the directory is creating a fork. Forking a repository on GitHub allows you to create a copy of a project under your own GitHub account. This lets you make changes without affecting the original repository. Here’s how you can fork a repository on GitHub:\n\nLog In to GitHub:\n\nMake sure you are logged in to your GitHub account.\n\nNavigate to the Repository:\n\nGo to the main page of the repository you want to fork: https://github.com/datasciencelabs/2024\n\nClick the ‘Fork’ Button:\n\nIn the top-right corner of the repository’s page, you’ll find the “Fork” button. Click on it.\n\nChoose an Account:\n\nIf you are a member of any organizations, GitHub will ask you where you’d like to fork the repository. Choose your personal account unless you want to fork it to an organization.\n\nWait for the Forking Process to Complete:\n\nGitHub will then create a copy of the repository in your account. You’ll see an animation indicating the process, and once it’s done, you’ll be redirected to the forked repository under your account.\n\nClone Your Forked Repository:\n\nTo work with the forked repository on your local machine, you can clone it. Navigate to the main page of your forked repo, click on the green “Code” button, copy the URL, and then use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\ngit clone [URL_you_copied]\n\n\nYou can continue to update the forked repository by doing the following:\n\nNavigate to Your Local Repository:\n\nOpen a terminal or command prompt.\nNavigate to the directory where you have your forked repository.\n\nAdd the Original Repository as an Upstream Remote:\n\nUse the following command to add the original repository as an upstream remote:\ngit remote add upstream [URL_of_original_repository]\nFor example, if the original repository’s URL is https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git, the command would be:\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git\n\nFetch Changes from the Upstream:\n\nUse the following command to fetch changes from the upstream:\ngit fetch upstream\n\nMerge Changes into Your Local Branch:\n\nFirst, ensure you are on the branch into which you want to merge the upstream changes, typically the main or master branch:\ngit checkout main\nThen, merge the changes from the upstream’s main or master branch:\ngit merge upstream/main\n\nPush Changes to Your Forked Repository on GitHub (if needed):\n\nIf you want these changes to reflect in your GitHub fork, push them:\ngit push origin main\n\n\nNow your fork is synchronized with the original repository. Whenever you want to pull in new changes from the original repository in the future, you just need to repeat steps 3-5.\nTo avoid conflicts you sill want to avoid editing the course notes files and instead make copies."

    "text": "Computations\nThe main reason we use Quarto is because we can include code and execute the code when compiling the document. In R we refer to them as R chunks.\nTo add your own R chunks, you can type the characters above quickly with the key binding command-option-I on the Mac and Ctrl-Alt-I on Windows.\nThis applies to plots as well; the plot will be placed in that position. We can write something like this:\n\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nBy default, the code will show up as well. To avoid having the code show up, you can use an argument, which are annotated with |# To avoid showing code in the final document, you can use the argument echo: FALSE. For example:\n\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWe recommend getting into the habit of adding a label to the R code chunks. This will be very useful when debugging, among other situations. You do this by adding a descriptive word like this:\n\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nAcademic reports\nQuarto has many nice features that facilitates publishing academic reports in this guide\nGlobal execution options\nIf you want to apply an option globally, you can include in the header, under execute. For example adding the following line to the header make code not show up, by default:\nexecute:\n  echo: false\nMore on markdown\nThere is a lot more you can do with R markdown. We highly recommend you continue learning as you gain more experience writing reports in R. There are many free resources on the internet including:\n\nRStudio’s tutorial: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html\nThe knitR book: https://yihui.name/knitr/\nPandoc’s Markdown in-depth documentation"

RStudio provides the Render button that makes it easier to compile the document.\nNote that the first time you click on the Render button, a dialog box may appear asking you to install packages you need. Once you have installed the packages, clicking Render will compile your Quarto file and the resulting document will pop up.\nThis particular example produces an html document which you can see in your working directory. To view it, open a terminal and list the files. You can open the file in a browser and use this to present your analysis. You can also produce a PDF or Microsoft document by changing:\nformat: html to format: pdf or format: docx. We can also produce documents that render on GitHub using format: gfm, which stands for GitHub flavored markdown, a convenient way to share your reports."

Students are required to have a GitHub account and create a repository for the course. We will be providing further instructions during the first lab.\n10% of the total points for the problem sets will be deducted for every late day. Students can have a total of 4 late days without penalty during the entire semester. No need to provide a written excuse. Providing an excuse does not give you more days unless an accommodation is requested and approved by the Office of Student Affairs (this includes COVID).\nProblem set submissions need to be completely reproducible Quarto documents.If your Quarto file does not compile it will be considered a late day, and you will be notified and will need to resubmit a Quarto file that does compile. You will be deducted further late days for every day it takes for you to turn in a Quarto file that does knit. You are required to check emails that come through the Canvas system, as this the only way we will communicate problems with your problem sets.",

This will require prior approval from the instructor by October 25.\nYet another option is to build a interactive webpage with poll-driven predictions for the 2024 US elections. Note this will be more challenging as we will not cover tools for interactive webpages until the last week of class (time permitting).\nNote: You should start working on your project after the first midterm.
