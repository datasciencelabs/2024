We will be working on these together during Wednesday labs. We also offer office hours where you can get help with unanswered questions.\nProblem sets must be submitted via GitHub. Students are required to have a GitHub account and create a repository for the course. We will be providing further instructions during the first lab.\n10% of the total points for the problem sets will be deducted for every late day. Students can have a total of 4 late days without penalty during the entire semester. No need to provide a written excuse. Providing an excuse does not give you more days unless an accommodation is requested and approved by the Office of Student Affairs (this includes COVID).\nProblem set submissions need to be completely reproducible Quarto documents. If your Quarto file does not compile it will be considered a late day, and you will be notified and will need to resubmit a Quarto file that does compile. You will be deducted further late days for every day it takes for you to turn in a Quarto file that does knit.

We can write something like this:\n```{r}\nx &lt;- 1\ny &lt;- 2\nx + y\n\n---\n\n## Computations\n\nBy default, the code will show up as well. To avoid having the code show up, you can use an argument, which are annotated with `|#` To avoid showing code in the final document, you can use the argument `echo: FALSE`. For example:\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: one-plus-two\nx &lt;- 1\ny &lt;- 2\nx + y\nWe recommend getting into the habit of adding a label to the R code chunks.

How many numbers does the list have? Hint: use seq and length.\nMake this data frame:\n\n\ntemp &lt;- c(35, 88, 42, 84, 81, 30)\ncity &lt;- c(\"Beijing\", \"Lagos\", \"Paris\", \"Rio de Janeiro\", \n          \"San Juan\", \"Toronto\")\ncity_temps &lt;- data.frame(name = city, temperature = temp)\n\nConvert the temperatures to Celsius.\n\nWrite a function euler that compute the following sum for any \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\nS_n = 1+1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + \\dots 1/n^2\n\\]\n\nShow that as \\(n\\) gets bigger we get closer \\(\\pi^2/6\\) by plotting \\(S_n\\) versus \\(n\\) with a horizontal dashed line at \\(\\pi^2/6\\).\nUse the %in% operator and the predefined object state.abb to create a logical vector that answers the question: which of the following are actual abbreviations: MA, ME, MI, MO, MU?\nExtend the code you used in the previous exercise to report the one entry that is not an actual abbreviation. Hint: use the ! operator, which turns FALSE into TRUE and viceversa, then which to obtain an index.\nIn the murders dataset, use %in% to show all variables for New York, California, and Texas, in that order.\nWrite a function called vandermonde_helper that for any \\(x\\) and \\(n\\), returns the vector \\((1 x x^2 x^3 \\dots x^n)\\). Show the results for \\(x=3\\) and \\(n=5\\).\nCreate a vector using:\n\n\nn &lt;- 10000\np &lt;- 0.5\nset.seed(2024-9-6)\nx &lt;- sample(c(0,1), n, prob = c(1 - p, p), replace = TRUE)\n\nCompute the length of each stretch of 1s and then plot the distribution of these values.
