After finishing the homework, you are to turn in all the code.

1. Start an RStudio project. Recommended name: `pset-01-rmarkdown`. Start a Quarto document called `beginning.qmd`.

2. Create a directory called `img` and save a screen shot of your RStudio session for the project. Include your screenshot in the Quarto document.

3. Next, in your Quarto document, define variables $a=1, b=-1, c=-2$ and print out the solutions to $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c=0$. Do not report complex solutions, only real numbers. 

4. Include a graph of $f(x)$ versus $x$ for $x \in (-5,5)$.

```{r}
x <- seq(-5, 5, length = 100)
# Hint: Use the plot function
```

5. Create a directory called `docs`. Use the command `quarto render` to create a PDF and save it to the `docs` directory. Show us the command you typed:

```
# Your code here
```

6. Use Unix to create a directory called `data` in the project home directory. Include the Unix command you used to create the directory.

```
# Your code here
```

7. Use a terminal-based text editor to create a file `coefs.txt` in the `data` directory and save three coefficients, `1 -1 -2` for example. Show us the Unix commands you used to achieve this:

```
# Your code here
```

8. Make a directory called `code`. Use Unix to copy the file `beginning.qmd` to a file called `quadratic.qmd` in the code directory. Show us the Unix commands you used.

```
# Your code here
```

9. Edit the `quadratic.qmd` file to read in `a`, `b`, and `c` from the file `coefs.txt`. Make sure to use a relative path when reading the file. As before, print out the solutions to $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c=0$. Do not report complex solutions, only real numbers. 

10. Change the path of the file you are reading to the full path you get when you type `file.path(getwd(), "data/coefs.txt")`. Confirm that the file still renders. Then move the entire `pset-01-rmarkdown` project to a directory called `RtmpyDknq4`.  Does the file render? Change the path back to a relative path and see if it renders.
