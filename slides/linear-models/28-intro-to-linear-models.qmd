## Linear Models

- We have focused mainly datasets consisting of a single variable.

- In data analyses challenges, it is very common to be interested in the relationship between two or more variables.

- We now introduce _linear models_, a general framework that unifies approaches used for analyzing association between variables.


## Linear Models

Linear models are useful for:

- simple and multivariate regression,

- measurement error models, 

- treatment effect models, and 

- association tests.
