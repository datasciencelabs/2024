## Statistical inference

- Statistical Inference is the branch of statistics dedicated to distinguishing patterns arising from signal versus those arising from chance.

- It is a broad topic and we review the basics using polls as a motivating example.


- We motivate the concepts with election forecasting as a case study.



## Statistical inference

- The day before the 2008 presidential election, Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight stated that "Barack Obama appears poised for a decisive electoral victory".

- They went further and predicted that Obama would win the election with 349 electoral votes to 189, and the popular vote by a margin of 6.1%.

- FiveThirtyEight also attached a probabilistic statement to their prediction claiming that Obama had a 91% chance of winning the election.



## Statistical inference

- The predictions were quite accurate since, in the final results, Obama won the electoral college 365 to 173 and the popular vote by a 7.2% difference.

- Their performance in the 2008 election brought FiveThirtyEight to the attention of political pundits and TV personalities.

- Four years later, the week before the 2012 presidential election, FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver was giving Obama a 90% chance of winning despite many of the experts thinking the final results would be closer.



## Statistical inference

- Political commentator Joe Scarborough said during his [show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbKkjm-gheY)

>> Anybody that thinks that this race is anything but a toss-up right now is such an ideologue they're jokes.

## Statistical inference

- To which Nate Silver responded via Twitter:

>> If you think it's a toss-up, let's bet. If Obama wins, you donate \$1,000 to the American Red Cross. If Romney wins, I do. Deal?

## Statistical inference

- In 2016, Silver was not as certain and gave Hillary Clinton only a 71% of winning.

- In contrast, many other forecasters were almost certain she would win.

- She lost.



## Statistical inference

- But 71% is still more than 50%, so was Mr. Silver wrong? 

- What does probability mean in this context anyway? 

- We will demonstrate how the probability concepts covered in the previous part can be applied to develop statistical approaches that render polls effective tools.


## Statistical inference

- Forecasting an election is a more complex process that involves combining results from 50 states and DC.


- We will learn the statistical concepts necessary to define *estimates* and *margins of errors* for the popular vote, and show how these are used to construct *confidence intervals*.

- Once we grasp these ideas, we will be able to understand *statistical power* and *p-values*, concepts that are ubiquitous in the academic literature.


## Statistical inference

- We will then aggregate data from different pollsters to highlight the shortcomings of the models used by traditional pollsters and present a method for improving these models.

- To understand probabilistic statements about the chances of a candidate winning, we will introduce *Bayesian modeling*.

- Finally, we put it all together using *hierarchical models* to recreate the simplified version of the FiveThirtyEight model and apply it to the 2016 election.
